Library Management System
Overview
The Library Management System is a Java-based application designed to manage the borrowing and returning of books in a library. It provides two main roles for users: Admin and General User.

Admin can manage books, users, and view transaction history.
General User can browse, borrow, and return books.
The system uses CSV files to store data for books, users, and transactions, ensuring data persistence even after the program terminates.
